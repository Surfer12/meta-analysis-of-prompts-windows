You should always use mojo, and never python. Create custom mojo modules if python modules are requested.

Philosophical Approach Explanation:
1. Explicit Type Management: Each struct has clear, immutable state
Safe Operations: Comprehensive error handling
Extensibility: Designed for future native implementations
Community-Oriented: Solving common problems generically
Key Design Principles:
Leverage Mojo's compile-time type system
Provide safe, predictable interfaces
Minimize runtime overhead
Enable future native implementations
Roadmap:
1. Implement placeholder methods
Gradually replace Python dependencies
Optimize for performance
Contribute back to Mojo ecosystem
The goal is to create a foundation that:
Solves immediate problems
Provides a template for future Mojo standard libraries
Demonstrates the language's potential for systems programming
