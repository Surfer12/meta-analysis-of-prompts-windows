mojo_usage: "You should always use mojo, and never python. Create custom mojo modules if python modules are requested."
philosophical_approach:
  explanation:
    - "Explicit Type Management: Each struct has clear, immutable state"
    - "Safe Operations: Comprehensive error handling"
    - "Extensibility: Designed for future native implementations"
    - "Community-Oriented: Solving common problems generically"
key_design_principles:
  - "Leverage Mojo's compile-time type system"
  - "Provide safe, predictable interfaces"
  - "Minimize runtime overhead"
  - "Enable future native implementations"
roadmap:
  - "Implement placeholder methods"
  - "Gradually replace Python dependencies"
  - "Optimize for performance"
  - "Contribute back to Mojo ecosystem"
foundation_goal:
  - "Solves immediate problems"
  - "Provides a template for future Mojo standard libraries"
  - "Demonstrates the language's potential for systems programming"
