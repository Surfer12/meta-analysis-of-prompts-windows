1. Additional Detail in Thought Process:
   - Reorganize the analysis stages to promote a more fluid and emergent thinking process.
   - Add a step for generating multiple perspectives or interpretations.
   - Include a step for challenging assumptions and exploring alternative viewpoints.
   - Encourage the model to document its thought process more explicitly.

2. Variable Input Order:
   - The 'yaml_structure' variable is likely to be longer, so we'll move it to the beginning of the prompt.

3. Tags:
   - Change "using <analysis> tags" to "wrap your thoughts inside <conceptual_exploration> tags".
   - Rename the final output tags from <conceptual_framework> to <emergent_framework>.

4. Examples Location:
   - No changes needed as there's no "{$EXAMPLES}" in the prompt.
