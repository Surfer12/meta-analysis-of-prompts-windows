Mirror Neuron System (Rizzolatti, 1996)

Initial Analysis:
This citation refers to the discovery of mirror neurons by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his team, which suggests a neurological basis for empathy and understanding. It's brought up as a related concept within a `<thought>` tag in the context of discussing Conway's Law in "ClaudeThinkingPersonalized.lua". This connection implies that the cognitive framework, by mirroring natural thought processes, might also tap into the brain's natural mechanisms for understanding and learning, potentially making it more intuitive and effective.
