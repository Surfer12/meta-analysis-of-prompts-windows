Design Thinking Methodology (Stanford d.school)

Initial Analysis:
This refers to the Design Thinking methodology popularized by the Stanford d.school. It's introduced in the `<thought>` tag of the Exploration section in "ClaudeThinkingPersonalized.lua" as a related concept to the framework's structure. The comparison highlights the similarities between the framework's stages (Understanding, Analysis, Exploration, Solution Formulation) and Design Thinking's phases (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype/Test). This suggests that the cognitive framework incorporates design thinking principles, such as user-centeredness, iterative prototyping, and a bias towards action.
