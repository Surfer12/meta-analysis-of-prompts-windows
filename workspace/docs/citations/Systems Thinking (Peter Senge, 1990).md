Systems Thinking (Peter Senge, 1990)

Initial Analysis:
This refers to Peter Senge's work on systems thinking, particularly his book "The Fifth Discipline." It's cited alongside Bloom's Taxonomy and mental models in the `<thinking>` tag of the Analysis section in "ClaudeThinkingPersonalized.lua". This indicates that the cognitive framework integrates systems thinking principles, emphasizing the understanding of interrelationships and feedback loops within complex systems. The framework likely uses systems thinking to analyze problems holistically, considering the broader context and potential consequences of different solutions.
