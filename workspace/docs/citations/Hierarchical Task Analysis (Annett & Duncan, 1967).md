## Hierarchical Task Analysis (Annett & Duncan, 1967)

Initial Analysis:
This refers to the technique of Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA), which involves breaking down complex tasks into subtasks and defining their relationships. It's introduced as a related concept within a `<thought>` tag in the Exploration section of the merged framework discussion in "ClaudeThinkingPersonalized.lua". This connection suggests that the cognitive framework incorporates principles of HTA, allowing for both top-down and bottom-up analysis of complex problems, making it adaptable to different levels of complexity.

Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) is a method for describing an activity in terms of its goals, subgoals, operations, and plans[4]. The process involves:

1. Defining the task and purpose of the analysis
2. Collecting data on the process
3. Determining the overall goal
4. Breaking down the goal into subgoals
5. Decomposing subgoals into operations
6. Developing plans to explain how goals should be accomplished

HTA provides a comprehensive task description and is useful for various human factors analysis methods. It can be applied across multiple domains but may be time-consuming for complex tasks.
