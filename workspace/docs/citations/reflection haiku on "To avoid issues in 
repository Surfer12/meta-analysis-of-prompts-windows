reflection haiku on "To avoid issues in future similar tasks, I will:
1. Always read the entire original file before making any edits
2. Preserve the exact initial analysis verbatim
3. Use minimal, precise edits
4. Double-check each file after modification
5. If uncertain, ask for clarification before proceeding" 
The key lesson is to treat the initial analysis as a sacred, unmodifiable piece of context that provides unique insight into the document's original interpretation.
