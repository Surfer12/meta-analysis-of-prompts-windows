## Bloom's Taxonomy (Benjamin Bloom, 1956)

Initial Analysis:
This citation refers to Bloom's Taxonomy, a hierarchical model of cognitive skills. It's mentioned in the context of structured analytical thinking within the `<thinking>` tag of the Analysis section in "ClaudeThinkingPersonalized.lua". This suggests that the cognitive framework being developed draws upon Bloom's model for categorizing different levels of thinking, from basic knowledge recall to higher-order skills like evaluation and creation. The framework likely incorporates these levels to ensure a comprehensive approach to problem-solving.

Bloom's Taxonomy is a hierarchical model that categorizes learning objectives into levels of complexity[2]. The original taxonomy, published in 1956, included three domains:

1. Cognitive (thinking skills)
2. Affective (emotional responses)
3. Psychomotor (physical skills)

The cognitive domain, which is most commonly used in educational settings, was revised in 2001 to reflect active learning processes[2]. The revised cognitive domain levels, from lowest to highest, are:

1. Remember
2. Understand
3. Apply
4. Analyze
5. Evaluate
6. Create

This taxonomy helps educators design effective learning objectives and assess student progress across different levels of cognitive complexity.
