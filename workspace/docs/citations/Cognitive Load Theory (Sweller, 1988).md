## Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988)

Initial Analysis:
This refers to John Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory, which deals with the limitations of working memory and how instructional design can optimize learning. It's introduced as a related concept within a `<thought>` tag in the context of discussing Conway's Law in "ClaudeThinkingPersonalized.lua". This connection suggests that the cognitive framework aims to minimize cognitive load by following natural mental structures, making it easier to apply and more effective for problem-solving.

Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), developed by John Sweller in the late 1980s, is based on the idea that our working memory has a limited capacity to process information[1]. The theory identifies three types of cognitive load:

1. Intrinsic load: Inherent difficulty of the task
2. Extraneous load: Unnecessary cognitive burden due to poor instruction design
3. Germane load: Effort required for learning and schema formation

CLT suggests that effective instructional design should minimize extraneous load, manage intrinsic load, and optimize germane load to facilitate learning[1]. This theory has significant implications for classroom instruction and curriculum design.
