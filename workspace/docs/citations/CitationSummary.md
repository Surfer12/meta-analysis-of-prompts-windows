# Citation Summaries: Cognitive and Analytical Frameworks

## 1. Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988)
**Key Focus:** Understanding cognitive processing limitations and optimizing learning
- Explores working memory's capacity
- Identifies three types of cognitive load:
  1. Intrinsic load (task difficulty)
  2. Extraneous load (unnecessary cognitive burden)
  3. Germane load (learning effort)
- Goal: Minimize cognitive barriers to enhance learning and problem-solving

## 2. Bloom's Taxonomy (Benjamin Bloom, 1956)
**Key Focus:** Hierarchical model of cognitive skills and learning objectives
- Categorizes learning into cognitive complexity levels
- Revised hierarchy from lowest to highest:
  1. Remember
  2. Understand
  3. Apply
  4. Analyze
  5. Evaluate
  6. Create
- Helps design effective learning objectives and assess cognitive progression

## 3. Hierarchical Task Analysis (Annett & Duncan, 1967)
**Key Focus:** Breaking down complex tasks into structured components
- Method for describing activities through goals, subgoals, and operations
- Process includes:
  1. Defining task purpose
  2. Collecting process data
  3. Determining overall goal
  4. Breaking down goals into subgoals
  5. Decomposing subgoals into operations
- Provides comprehensive task description across domains

## 4. Mental Models (Kenneth Craik, 1943)
**Key Focus:** Internal representations of external reality
- Explores how minds construct cognitive frameworks
- Emphasizes the role of mental models in understanding and decision-making
- Suggests that accurate mental models improve problem analysis

## 5. Mirror Neuron System (Rizzolatti, 1996)
**Key Focus:** Neurological basis for empathy and understanding
- Discovers neurons that mirror observed actions
- Suggests natural mechanisms for learning and comprehension
- Implies intuitive understanding through neurological mirroring

## 6. Mixed Methods Research (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003)
**Key Focus:** Integrative research approach
- Combines multiple research methodologies
- Aims for comprehensive understanding
- Promotes holistic analysis by integrating diverse perspectives

## 7. Systems Thinking (Peter Senge, 1990)
**Key Focus:** Holistic approach to understanding complex systems
- Emphasizes interrelationships and feedback loops
- Analyzes problems in broader contextual frameworks
- Considers systemic consequences of solutions

## 8. Design Thinking Methodology (Stanford d.school)
**Key Focus:** User-centered problem-solving approach
- Iterative process for innovative solutions
- Stages include:
  1. Empathize
  2. Define
  3. Ideate
  4. Prototype/Test
- Promotes action-oriented, user-centric problem resolution

**Meta-Insight:** These frameworks collectively suggest that effective problem-solving requires:
- Understanding cognitive limitations
- Structured analytical approaches
- Holistic system perspectives
- Adaptable and iterative methodologies
