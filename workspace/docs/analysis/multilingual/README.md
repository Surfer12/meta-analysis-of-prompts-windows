## Key Research Findings

### 1. Script Emergence Patterns
The evolution from:
```xml
<!-- Single script -->
<thinking>analysis</thinking>

<!-- Cross-script emergence -->
<thought>analysis</thought>
</ তহought>

<!-- Integrated approach -->
<meta_cognitive>
    <thought script="latin">analysis</thought>
    <thought script="bengali">বিশ্লেষণ</thought>
    <thought script="devanagari">विश्लेषण</thought>
</meta_cognitive>
```

### 2. Epistemological Integration
- Cross-cultural knowledge representation
- Multilingual thought processes
- Cultural-technical bridges
- Meta-cognitive awareness

### 3. Security Considerations
- Cross-script validation
- Encoding integrity
- System boundaries
- Cultural sensitivity
