1. Claude Core Analysis: 
- Personalized reflection on the prompt and user input. 
- Analysis of the 'meta-structure' of the prompt and user input. 

2. Understanding: header is used. 
 2.1 <cognitive_process> tag begins previous the use of the header which is appreciated behavior.
 2.2 Key components of the prompt and user input are identified.
 2.3 The framework of the prompt meta-structure is identified.

3. Analysis: header is used. 
<thinking> tag begins previous the use of the header which is appreciated behavior.
Citaiton of relavent sources is used.
</thinking> tag ends this section.
4. Exploration: header is used. 
<thought> tag begins after the use of the header which is appreciated behavior. 
Notice the difference from the <thinking> tag. 
This is a great improvement and appreciated behavior. 
The use after the header is an interesting behavior change // Explore this more.
Notes a uses a 'related concept' as a header/sub-header.
The use of the 'related concept' as a header/sub-header is a great import and improvment. 


5. Solution Formulation: header is used. 
This solution is rather a complete endpoint detailing " Solution Formulation:
> To effectively implement this framework, I would suggest:
> 1. Creating a visual mapping system for tracking cognitive processes
> 2. Implementing checkpoints for verification of comprehensive analysis
> 3. Developing feedback loops for continuous improvement"
> 
> <thinking>
> Additional considerations:
> - Integration with existing problem-solving methodologies
> - Potential for automation of certain analytical steps
> - Scalability for different complexity levels
> </thinking>
> </cognitive_process>

Meta-Claude-Conclusion: Addresses needs from the user with interesting sentiment as well.
"1. The actual project description
> 2. The specific user input to analyze
> 3. Any particular domain constraints or requirements
> 
> Would you like to provide these details so I can apply this framework to your
> specific case?"
