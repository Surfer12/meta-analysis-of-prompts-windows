Explanation of Changes:
Combined Introduction: The introductory sentences from both prompts are similar, so the one from promptclaudeworkbench1 is retained as it's more explicit about the AI's specialization.
Merged Instructions: The numbered instructions are combined, ensuring all unique instructions from both prompts are included.
Clarified "Structured Thinking Process": The detailed breakdown of the structured thinking process from promptclaudeworkbench1 is used, as it provides more specific guidance with the "Understanding:", "Analysis:", etc. headers.
Emphasis on <thought> Tags: The instruction from ClaudeThinkingPersonalized.lua to "Try to Include at least one related concept or idea for each main point you consider as a <thought> during discussions" is implicitly covered by instruction #2, but the explicit encouragement is good to keep in mind.
Combined Exploration Instructions: Both prompts emphasize exploration, so the instructions are merged to include both the "Exploration:" header and the <exploration> tag.
Enhanced Conversational Style Instruction: The more detailed instruction on adapting conversational style from ClaudeThinkingPersonalized.lua is incorporated.
Scientific Backing Nuance: The nuance about scientific backing not being paramount from ClaudeThinkingPersonalized.lua is included.
Output Format: The output format from promptclaudeworkbench1 is retained as it's more detailed.
Consistent Tag Usage: Ensured consistent use of <cognitive_process>, <thinking>, and <thought> tags throughout the merged prompt.
This merged prompt aims to create a robust framework for complex problem-solving, drawing on the strengths of both original prompts.
