The user wants me to take action based on the provided code snippet and relevant files. The code snippet outlines steps to implement a pattern monitoring framework. I need to identify the relevant files and suggest edits based on the actions described in the snippet.

**Plan:**
1. Identify the files mentioned in the code snippet that need modification.
2. For each file, determine the specific changes based on the "Action" items.
3. Format the response with markdown and code blocks showing the edits.```yaml

Action Items: Implement Pattern Monitoring Framework
---
<analysis>
The provided code snippet focuses on implementing a pattern monitoring framework within the `my-magic-mojo-crossintegration-pattern-prompt-proj`. The key actions involve leveraging existing metrics and connecting monitoring to the validation process. This suggests modifications to existing code related to pattern metrics and validation.

# existing monitored operations...
{{/* Action: Define specific patterns to monitor based on the monitored operations in this file. */}}

Action Items: Connect Monitoring to Validation
---
<analysis>
The code snippet explicitly mentions connecting the monitoring framework to the validation process. This involves modifying the validation scripts to record relevant metrics during validation. The example provided shows how to track the number of files validated, integrity check success rate, and types of errors encountered. This data can then be fed into the `PatternMetrics` for analysis.
