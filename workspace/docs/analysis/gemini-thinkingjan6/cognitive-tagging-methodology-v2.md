The user wants to integrate the "Key Principles" section and the initial lines (1-28) of the system prompt into the YAML structure defined in the other provided file. This means representing the core instructions and principles within the YAML format, making the prompt more consistently structured.

**Plan:**
1. **Identify the key concepts:** Extract the core ideas from the "Key Principles" section.
2. **Represent principles in YAML:**  Translate each principle into a YAML key-value pair, ensuring clarity and conciseness.
3. **Integrate initial lines into YAML:**  Find a suitable place within the existing YAML structure to incorporate the introductory sentences of the prompt. This could be under a top-level key like `introduction` or `overview`.
4. **Ensure consistency:** Maintain the overall YAML structure and formatting established in the other file.
