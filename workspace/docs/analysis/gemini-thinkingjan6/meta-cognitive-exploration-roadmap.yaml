next_steps_analysis:
  description: >
    The user wants to know the next steps in the development process, based on
    the provided code snippets and a YAML document outlining immediate actions.
    The YAML document suggests "Consolidate and Refine Existing Frameworks".
    Looking at the file names and content, there are several files related to
    validation and integrity checking in both Python and Mojo, as well as files
    related to the Cognitive Bridge, Visitors, and Autopoietic Systems.

  consolidate_validation_frameworks:
    action_items: Consolidate and Refine Validation Frameworks
    analysis: >
      The project has both Python (file_validation.py, integrity_validator.py)
      and Mojo (integrity_validator.mojo, mojo_integrity_validator.mojo)
      validation scripts.
    steps:
      review_and_unify_validation_logic:
        description: >
          The project has both Python and Mojo validation scripts that need
          to be unified.
        actions:
          - Compare functionality and logic, identify common elements
          - Decide on primary language for core validation logic
          - Refactor validation logic to minimize duplication
          - Ensure consistent error handling
      enhance_mojo_native_validation:
        description: The mojo_integrity_validator.mojo is described as minimalistic.
        actions:
          - Expand functionality to match Python validators
          - Implement native file system operations
      standardize_reporting:
        description: Both Python and Mojo validators have generate_report methods.
        actions:
          - Define consistent report format
          - Ensure both implementations follow format

  implement_pattern_monitoring_framework:
    description: >
      Implementation plan for the pattern monitoring framework within the
      cross-integration project.
    plan:
      - Identify files needing modification
      - Determine specific changes based on actions
      - Format response with proper documentation
    action_items: Implement Pattern Monitoring Framework
    analysis: >
      The framework needs to leverage existing metrics and connect monitoring
      to the validation process.
    code_edits:
      pattern_metrics:
        filename: pattern_metrics.mojo
        description: >
          Integrate the PatternMetrics struct into the main Cognitive Design
          Framework.
      pattern_configs:
        filename: pattern_configs.yaml
        description: Define specific patterns to monitor based on configurations.
      monitored_operations:
        filename: MONITORED_OPERATIONS.yaml
        description: Define patterns based on monitored operations.
      validation_script:
        filename: validation_scripts/validation_script.py
        description: >
          Modify validation scripts to record metrics like file count,
          success rate, and error types.

  connect_monitoring_to_validation:
    action_items: Connect Monitoring to Validation
    analysis: >
      Connect the monitoring framework to the validation process by modifying
      scripts to record metrics.
    steps:
      leverage_existing_metrics:
        description: >
          Use pattern_metrics.mojo as starting point for tracking metrics.
        actions:
          - Integrate PatternMetrics into main framework
          - Define patterns based on configurations
      connect_monitoring:
        description: Use validation process for monitoring data.
        actions:
          - Record relevant metrics during validation

  address_python_interoperability:
    description: Handle Python integration requirements
    steps:
      review_integration_rules:
        description: Follow Mojo and Python Integration Ruleset
      handle_type_conversions:
        description: Use proper type conversions between languages
      manage_exceptions:
        description: Ensure proper exception handling in cross-language calls

  consider_cognitive_bridge_and_visitor_pattern:
    steps:
      refine_visitor_usage:
        description: >
          Ensure consistent visitor pattern application across the codebase.
        actions:
          - Review visitor pattern implementation
          - Integrate with CognitiveBridge
          - Define clear visitor responsibilities

  testing_and_documentation:
    steps:
      write_unit_tests:
        description: Create comprehensive test suite
        actions:
          - Write Python validation tests
          - Write Mojo validation tests
      update_documentation:
        description: Keep documentation current
        actions:
          - Document validation framework
          - Document monitoring implementation
          - Update architecture documentation

  conclusion: >
    Focus on consolidating validation capabilities, implementing pattern
    monitoring, and maintaining robust documentation. Prioritize pure Mojo
    implementations where possible and manage Python interoperability carefully.
