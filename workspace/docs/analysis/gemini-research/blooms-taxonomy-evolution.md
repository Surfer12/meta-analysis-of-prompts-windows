Bloom's Taxonomy
Bloom's Taxonomy is a hierarchical model that classifies educational learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity. It was created by Benjamin Bloom, an American educational psychologist, in 1956, with the goal of providing educators with a common language for discussing and exchanging learning and assessment methods 1. The taxonomy is based on the idea that cognitive operations can be ordered into six increasingly complex levels, each building upon the previous one 3. Bloom's Taxonomy has been widely adopted as a way to align educational goals, curricula, and assessments that are used in schools 4. It has also undergone revisions over time to reflect evolving educational goals and practices.
Benjamin Bloom
Benjamin Samuel Bloom (February 21, 1913 â€“ September 13, 1999) was an American educational psychologist who made significant contributions to the field of education 5. His research focused on student achievement and the factors that influence learning 6. Bloom observed that educational settings and home environments could significantly impact a child's learning 6. He hypothesized that adapting teaching methods to individual needs would improve learning outcomes for more children 5. This led to the development of Bloom's Mastery Learning procedure, which emphasizes personalized instruction and frequent feedback 5.
Bloom's work with the taxonomy stemmed from his research on student achievement. Through various studies, Bloom and his colleagues observed factors within the school environment, as well as outside of it, that can affect how children learn. One example was the lack of variation in teaching 6. Bloom's taxonomy was developed to improve communication between educators on the design of curricula and examinations 1.
Bloom's work extended beyond Mastery Learning and the taxonomy. He also chaired the research and development committees of the College Entrance Examinations Board and served as President of the American Educational Research Association in 1965 3. In his later years, Bloom focused on talent development in young people, leading a research team that produced the book "Developing Talent in Young People" in 1985 3. His contributions to education have had a lasting impact on educational practices and philosophies worldwide 5.
Original Publication
Bloom's Taxonomy was first published in 1956 in the book "Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals" 3. This publication was the result of a series of conferences held from 1949 to 1953, aimed at improving communication among educators regarding curriculum design and examinations 1. The taxonomy was initially divided into three domains:
Cognitive: This domain focuses on knowledge and intellectual skills.
Affective: This domain deals with emotions, attitudes, and values.
Psychomotor: This domain encompasses physical skills and coordination.
The cognitive domain received the most attention and has been widely used in education 7. In its original form, it consisted of six hierarchical levels: Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation 7.
Six Levels of Bloom's Taxonomy
The six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy represent a hierarchy of cognitive skills, from the most basic to the most complex 8. Each level builds upon the skills acquired at the previous level. In the original version of the taxonomy, evaluation was the highest level of the cognitive domain 9. However, in 2001, the taxonomy was revised, renaming and reordering the levels to Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create 1. In the revised version, "create" is the highest level of the cognitive domain.
1. Knowledge (Remember)
This is the foundation of the taxonomy and involves remembering previously learned information, such as facts, terms, and concepts 1. It is the most basic level of cognitive skills. Examples of verbs that correspond to this level are: list, define, tell, describe, identify, show, label, collect, examine, tabulate, quote, name, who, when, and where 10.
2. Comprehension (Understand)
Comprehension goes beyond simple recall and requires understanding the meaning of information 1. It involves interpreting, translating, and summarizing information. Examples of verbs that correspond to this level are: summarize, describe, interpret, contrast, predict, associate, distinguish, estimate, differentiate, discuss, and extend 10.
3. Application (Apply)
At this level, individuals use their knowledge and understanding to solve problems in new situations 1. It involves applying learned concepts and principles to real-world scenarios. Examples of verbs that correspond to this level are: apply, demonstrate, calculate, complete, illustrate, show, solve, examine, modify, relate, change, classify, experiment, and discover 10.
4. Analysis (Analyze)
Analysis involves breaking down information into its component parts to understand the relationships and organization of ideas 1. It requires identifying patterns, recognizing assumptions, and drawing conclusions. Examples of verbs that correspond to this level are: analyze, separate, order, explain, connect, classify, arrange, divide, compare, select, and infer 10.
5. Synthesis (Evaluate)
Synthesis is the ability to combine different pieces of information to create something new 8. It involves generating creative solutions, designing experiments, and formulating hypotheses. Examples of verbs that correspond to this level are: combine, integrate, modify, rearrange, substitute, plan, create, design, invent, what if?, compose, formulate, prepare, generalize, and rewrite 10.
6. Evaluation (Create)
Evaluation involves making judgments about the value of information or ideas based on criteria and standards 1. Examples of verbs that correspond to this level are: assess, decide, rank, grade, test, measure, recommend, convince, select, judge, explain, discriminate, support, conclude, compare, and summarize 10.
Examples of Each Level
Here are some concrete examples of how each level of Bloom's Taxonomy can be applied in an educational setting:




Level
Example
Description
Remember
Define photosynthesis.
Students recall the definition of photosynthesis.
Understand
Summarize the plot of a book you have read.
Students demonstrate their understanding of the plot by summarizing it in their own words.
Apply
Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
Students use their knowledge of the Pythagorean Theorem to solve a mathematical problem.
Analyze
Compare and contrast the characters in a story.
Students break down the characters and identify similarities and differences.
Evaluate
Evaluate a movie based on its plot, acting, and directing.
Students make judgments about the quality of the movie based on specific criteria.
Create
Write an original song about the American Revolution.
Students combine their knowledge and creativity to produce a new piece of work.

Bloom's Taxonomy in Education
Bloom's Taxonomy is a valuable tool for educators in various aspects of teaching and learning. Teachers can use Bloom's Taxonomy to design questions and assignments that are closely related to the learning objectives at each stage of the process 11. For example, multiple-choice questions can help determine a student's basic understanding and how well they remember the topic, whereas asking them to come up with an analogy indicates that they are ready to proceed to the application or analytical stage 11.
Bloom's Taxonomy helps instructors identify clear learning objectives and create purposeful learning activities and instructional materials 12. It provides a framework for classifying instructional objectives and goals, ensuring that all orders of thinking are exercised in students' learning process 7. The goal of an educator using Bloom's Taxonomy is to encourage higher-order thought in their students by building up from lower-level cognitive skills 2.
Revised Bloom's Taxonomy (2001)
In 2001, a group of cognitive psychologists, curriculum theorists, instructional researchers, and testing specialists revised Bloom's Taxonomy 14. 
One significant change in the revised taxonomy was the shift from nouns to verbs in the category names 15. 
This change aimed to describe learners' thinking processes rather than just their behaviors 15. For example, instead of "Knowledge," the revised taxonomy uses "Remembering." This shift emphasizes the active nature of learning.

Another significant change was the reordering of the levels, with "Creating" becoming the highest level in the revised taxonomy 15. This change reflects the growing emphasis on creativity and innovation in education. The revised taxonomy arranges skills from the most basic to the most complex, with "Creating" at the top, followed by "Evaluating," "Analyzing," "Applying," "Understanding," and "Remembering" 15.
Revised Bloom's Taxonomy (2001)
Shifted category names from nouns to verbs to describe learners' thinking processes rather than just their behaviors.
Reordered the levels, making "Creating" the highest level to emphasize creativity and innovation in education.
The revised taxonomy arranges skills from the most basic to the most complex:
Creating
Evaluating
Analyzing
Applying
Understanding
Remembering
Criticisms of Bloom's Taxonomy
While Bloom's Taxonomy has been widely adopted and praised for its contributions to education, it has also faced some criticisms. One of the main criticisms is that it is too rigid and linear 16. Some argue that learning is not always a linear process and that students may move back and forth between levels 16. 

Bloom's Taxonomy has had a profound impact on education, providing educators with a common language for discussing learning objectives and designing effective instruction. The taxonomy's hierarchical structure helps to organize cognitive skills and encourages educators to foster higher-order thinking in their students. While the original taxonomy has undergone revisions to reflect evolving educational goals, its core principles remain relevant.
The revised Bloom's Taxonomy (2001) addressed some of the limitations of the original framework by shifting the focus from nouns to verbs and reordering the levels to emphasize creativity. Despite criticisms regarding its rigidity and focus on cognitive skills, Bloom's Taxonomy continues to be a valuable tool for educators in designing curricula, assessments, and teaching methods that promote meaningful learning experiences. The criticisms, however, contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the taxonomy's role in contemporary education, where diverse learning styles and non-cognitive skills are increasingly recognized as essential aspects of holistic development.
