# Mental Models (Kenneth Craik, 1943)

## Abstract

A foundational exploration of how the human mind creates internal representations of external reality to understand, predict, and interact with the world.

## Key Concepts

- Internal representations
- Cognitive modeling
- Predictive reasoning
- Small-scale mental simulations

## Main Content

### Theoretical Foundation

Kenneth Craik proposed that the mind constructs "small-scale models" of reality to anticipate events, reason, and explain complex systems. These mental models serve as cognitive tools for understanding and interacting with our environment.

### Cognitive Modeling Principles

- Mental models are simplified representations of complex systems
- They allow for prediction and explanation of events
- Models can be constructed from perception, imagination, and knowledge

### Significance in Cognitive Science

- Laid groundwork for modern cognitive psychology
- Influenced understanding of human reasoning
- Provided framework for studying cognitive processes
