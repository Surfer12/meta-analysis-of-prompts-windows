# Mirror Neuron System (Rizzolatti, 1996)

## Abstract

The mirror neuron system (MNS) is a groundbreaking neurological discovery that reveals how the brain simulates and understands actions and emotions through a unique neural mirroring mechanism.

## Key Concepts

- Neural mirroring
- Action understanding
- Empathy mechanisms
- Premotor cortex functionality

## Main Content

### Discovery and Basic Mechanism

The mirror neuron system is a network of neurons activated both when an individual performs an action and when they observe another individual performing the same action. This "mirroring" of behavior allows us to simulate the actions of others in our own minds, forming the foundation of our capacity for empathy and social understanding.

### Neurological Location and Functionality

Mirror neurons are primarily located in:
- Premotor cortex
- Inferior parietal cortex

#### Types of Mirror Neurons
- Canonical neurons: Respond to object presentation
- Mirror neurons: Respond to action performance and observation

### Empathy and Emotional Understanding

The mirror neuron system plays a crucial role in:
- Emotional simulation
- Intention understanding
- Non-verbal communication
