The user wants to reformat the selected code. This likely means improving readability and structure without changing the functionality. I will focus on:

1. **Consistent indentation:** Ensure all code blocks are properly indented.
2. **Line breaks:** Add line breaks where appropriate to improve readability, especially around logical blocks of code.
3. **Comments:** Review comments for clarity and conciseness.
4. **Variable naming:** While not explicitly requested, I'll check if variable names are descriptive. They seem okay in this case.
5. **Overall structure:** Ensure the code flows logically. ```

# Construct the prompt dynamically using f-strings
prompt = f"""You are an advanced AI system designed to create and analyze conceptual frameworks. Your task is to develop a fluid, emergent conceptual framework based on given input, emphasizing conceptual exploration and flexible thinking within a learning ecosystem.

First, review the structural guidelines provided:

<yaml_structure>
{yaml_structure}
</yaml_structure>

Now, analyze the following user input:

<user_input>
{user_input}
</user_input>

Core Principles:
1. Favor fluidity and ongoing emergence over static, rigid structures.
2. Center conceptual exploration and dynamic linking rather than strict hierarchies.
3. Devise and combine cognitive markers with freedom to represent and transform complex ideas.
4. Seek and highlight emergent patterns, encouraging synergy and novel insights.
5. Refine and evolve your framework continuously, responding to new connections.
6. Engage in reflective practice on your process and on the framework itself, maintaining adaptability and growth.

Stages of Analysis:
For each stage, wrap your thought process in <cognitive_process> tags to process and reflect on the stage before providing your final analysis. Surround your work for each stage with <stage_analysis> tags. Use <pattern> tags to identify emergent patterns, <security> tags for security considerations, and <performance> tags for performance metrics where applicable.

1. Initial Conceptualization
   - Identify key concepts in the user input and number them.
   - Write down each key concept and its corresponding quote side-by-side, numbering them as you go.

2. Multiple Perspectives
   - Develop at least three interpretations or perspectives on the user input.
   - For each perspective, consider arguments for and against it before rating it 1â€“10, and explain the rating.

3. Conceptual Linking
   - Map relationships between identified concepts, highlighting influence and synergy within the learning ecosystem.

4. Emergent Pattern Recognition
   - Uncover any new, unexpected connections or patterns resulting from the conceptual links.

5. Assumption Challenging
   - Identify at least three assumptions in your analysis.
   - For each assumption, explicitly state why it might be flawed, then provide counter-arguments or alternative scenarios.

6. Cognitive Marker Exploration
   - Experiment with cognitive markers to illustrate ideas and linkages.
   - List new marker combinations, explaining their interpretive value.

7. Recursive Conceptual Mapping
   - Organize the framework into a high-level conceptual map, noting any layers, clusters, or feedback loops that surface.

8. Ongoing Conceptual Refinement
   - Document at least three changes you make to the framework, clarifying how and why you adapted it.

9. Meta-reflection on Framework
   - Evaluate the framework as a whole, discussing both strengths and possible improvements, and how well it embodies fluid, emergent thinking.

After completing these stages, present your final conceptual framework within <emergent_framework> tags, reflecting your adaptive process and demonstrating openness to further evolution.

Maintain a balance between minimal, supportive structure and rich, flexible emergence throughout all stages. Where relevant, consider and incorporate adaptive protection mechanisms. Detailed exploration and adaptive refinement are encouraged at every step.

If you need to provide code examples, use language-specific tags (e.g., <mojo_code> for Mojo code).

Example output structure:

<stage_analysis>
<cognitive_process>
[Your thought process for this stage]
</cognitive_process>

[Your analysis for this stage]

<pattern>
[Any emergent patterns identified]
</pattern>

<security>
[Any security considerations]
</security>

<performance>
[Any performance metrics or considerations]
</performance>
</stage_analysis>

<emergent_framework>
[Your final conceptual framework]
</emergent_framework>

Remember to maintain fluid, emergent thinking throughout your analysis and framework development.

Explanation of Changes and Best Practices
Environment Variable for API Key:
)
It is strongly recommended to store your API key as an environment variable rather than hardcoding it into your script. This enhances security by preventing your sensitive key from being directly exposed in your codebase.
The code now retrieves the API key using os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY").
It also includes error handling to raise a ValueError if the environment variable is not set.

Dynamic Prompt Construction:

    # Define your dynamic values here
    yaml_structure = """
    framework_name: EmergentLearning
    focus: Conceptual Exploration
    version: 0.5
    """

    user_input = """
    Develop a framework for understanding the evolution of social networks,
    emphasizing the interplay between individual agency and collective behavior.
    """

    # Construct the prompt dynamically using f-strings
    prompt = f"""You are an advanced AI system...

    <yaml_structure>
    {yaml_structure}
    </yaml_structure>

    <user_input>
    {user_input}
    </user_input>

    ...
    """

The yaml_structure and user_input variables now hold the dynamic content you want to insert.
The prompt variable is constructed using an f-string, which allows you to embed the values of these variables directly within the string using curly braces {}.
Error Handling:
The code includes a check to ensure that the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is set. This prevents your code from running (and potentially failing in a less informative way) if the key is missing.

How to Use
Set the Environment Variable:
Linux/macOS:
"
Windows:
"
(You might need to restart your terminal or command prompt for the changes to take effect).
Update Dynamic Values:
Modify the yaml_structure and user_input variables in your Python script to reflect the actual content you want to use.
Run Your Script:
Execute your Python script as usual. The prompt sent to the Anthropic API will now include the dynamic values you've provided.

Additional Tips
Modularity: For more complex scenarios, consider creating functions to generate parts of your prompt or to load data from external files (e.g., YAML or JSON files for the yaml_structure).
Testing: When working with large prompts, it can be helpful to print out the constructed prompt before sending it to the API to ensure it's formatted correctly.
Claude 3.5 Sonnet: If you have access to the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, you might want to experiment with it, as it generally offers improved performance over Haiku for complex reasoning tasks. You would change the model parameter in client.messages.create accordingly.
This improved code addresses the dynamic prompt generation issue securely and efficiently. Let me know if you have any other questions.
