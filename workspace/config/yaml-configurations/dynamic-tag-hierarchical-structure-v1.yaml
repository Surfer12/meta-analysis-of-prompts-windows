Hierarchical Tag Structures: Dynamic Tagging and Prompt Type Integration
Here's how we can apply hierarchical tag structures to the dynamic tag system, focusing on integrating creative writing prompts:
1. Top-Level Tag: prompt_type
This tag categorizes the overarching purpose of the prompt. It would have subtags for different prompt categories, including creative writing prompts.
prompt_type:
 description: The overarching category of the prompt.
 allowed_values: [argumentative, analytical, problem_solving, creative_writing]

2. Creative Writing Subtags
Under the creative_writing subtag, we can include tags for specific types of creative writing prompts.
  creative_writing:
   description: Prompts focused on creative writing.
   subtags: [narrative, poem, script, linguistic_creation]

3. Integration Tags
These tags represent the integration of creative writing elements into other prompt types.
  integration_tags:
   - narrative_analogy: Using a narrative to illustrate a concept.
     applies_to: [argumentative, analytical]
   - poetic_metaphor: Using poetic language to express an idea.
     applies_to: [argumentative, analytical]
   - storytelling_structure: Applying narrative structure to organize information.
     applies_to: [problem_solving, analytical]

4. Additional Subtags
We can further refine the hierarchy by adding subtags under the integration tags to specify the type of creative element used.
  storytelling_structure:
   description: Applying narrative structure to organize information.
   applies_to: [problem_solving, analytical]
   subtags:
     - plot_structure: Using plot elements (exposition, rising action, climax, etc.)
     - character_development: Developing characters to represent different aspects of the problem.
     - setting_design: Creating a setting that reflects the context of the problem.

5. Tag Attributes
We can also add attributes to the tags to provide more specific information.
  poetic_metaphor:
   description: Using poetic language to express an idea.
   applies_to: [argumentative, analytical]
   attributes:
     type:
       allowed_values: [simile, metaphor, personification]
       description: The specific type of poetic metaphor used.

Example
Here's an example of how this hierarchical structure could be used to represent a prompt that combines argumentative and creative elements:
prompt_type: argumentative
task: Persuade the reader to adopt a plant-based diet.
tags:
 - argument
 - health
 - environment
 - ethics
 - narrative_analogy
   attributes:
     creative_writing:
       subtags: [narrative]

This structure clearly shows that the prompt is primarily argumentative but incorporates a narrative analogy to enhance its persuasive power.
This approach allows for a flexible and nuanced representation of various prompt types and their potential combinations with creative writing elements. It provides a clear framework for understanding how creative prompts can be integrated to enhance the engagement and effectiveness of other prompt types.
