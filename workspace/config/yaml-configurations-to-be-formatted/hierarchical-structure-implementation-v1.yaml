Implementing a hierarchical structure for tags can greatly enhance the organization and expressiveness of your tagging system. Here's how you can approach it:
1. Parent-Child Relationships
* Define tags that have parent tags, creating a hierarchical breakdown of the prompt's structure.
* This allows for a more organized representation of the prompt's elements and their relationships.
Example
- name: problem_solving
 description: A process of identifying and resolving a problem.
 subtags: [problem_definition, solution_generation, evaluation]

1. Tag Combinations
* Allow multiple tags to be applied to a single piece of text to represent complex relationships or characteristics.
* This enables a more nuanced description of the text and captures the interplay between different elements.
Example
tags:
 - question
 - hypothesis
 - argument

1. Tag Inheritance
* Allow tags to inherit properties or attributes from their parent tags.
* This promotes efficiency and consistency in the tag structure.
Example
- name: creative_writing
 description: A piece of text that uses imaginative language.
 attributes:
   form: [poem, narrative]
   style: [descriptive, lyrical]

- name: poem
 description: A piece of writing in verse form.
 inherits: creative_writing # Inherits form and style attributes

1. YAML Implementation
Here's how you can represent this hierarchical structure in YAML:
tag_categories:
 - name: problem_solving
   description: A process of identifying and resolving a problem.
   subtags:
     - name: problem_definition
       description: Defining the problem to be solved.
     - name: solution_generation
       description: Generating potential solutions.
     - name: evaluation
       description: Evaluating the effectiveness of the solutions.

 - name: argumentation
   description: A claim or assertion that requires justification.
   subtags:
     - name: thesis
       description: The main argument.
     - name: counterargument
       description: An argument opposing the thesis.
     - name: rebuttal
       description: Refuting the counterargument.
