file_renaming_strategy:
  overview: |
    Systematic renaming of research documentation files to enhance clarity,
    traceability, and cognitive understanding of the content.

  guiding_principles:
    - Emphasize cognitive processes and meta-reflection
    - Highlight iterative and adaptive design approaches
    - Capture conceptual emergence and flexibility
    - Provide structural and functional analysis context
    - Incorporate monitoring and validation framework insights

  renaming_methodology:
    yaml_files:
      - original: v1.yaml
        renamed: prompt-engineering-structural-constraints-v1.yaml
        rationale: Emphasizes initial structural constraints in prompt engineering

      - original: v2yaml.yaml
        renamed: prompt-engineering-conceptual-connections-v2.yaml
        rationale: Highlights evolving conceptual connections in prompt design

      - original: v3self.yaml
        renamed: prompt-engineering-recursive-meta-reflection-v3.yaml
        rationale: Captures recursive meta-reflection and self-improvement aspects

      - original: next-steps.yaml
        renamed: meta-cognitive-exploration-roadmap.yaml
        rationale: Represents the roadmap for meta-cognitive exploration

      - original: action-item-connect-monitoring-to-validation.yaml
        renamed: cognitive-monitoring-validation-framework.yaml
        rationale: Focuses on the cognitive monitoring and validation process

    markdown_files:
      - original: "The user wants to revise the system prom.md"
        renamed: prompt-refinement-iterative-design-notes.md
        rationale: Captures the iterative design process of prompt refinement

      - original: "The user wants to see examples of how th.md"
        renamed: meta-observation-cognitive-emergence-examples.md
        rationale: Highlights cognitive emergence through meta-observation

      - original: "The user wants to refine the system prom"
        renamed: prompt-engineering-adaptive-strategy-process.md
        rationale: Emphasizes adaptive strategies in prompt engineering

      - original: "The user wants a system prompt that enco"
        renamed: prompt-design-cognitive-flexibility-principles.md
        rationale: Focuses on cognitive flexibility in prompt design

      - original: 1.md
        renamed: meta-cognitive-initial-pattern-recognition.md
        rationale: Represents initial pattern recognition in meta-cognitive analysis

      - original: impliment-pattern-monitoring-gemthinking.md
        renamed: cognitive-monitoring-pattern-exploration.md
        rationale: Explores cognitive monitoring patterns

      - original: "Component Breakdown and Functional Description Analysisy.md"
        renamed: cognitive-architecture-functional-decomposition.md
        rationale: Provides functional decomposition of cognitive architecture

      - original: promptv6yamlformat-structured-expl-of-system-architecuture.md
        renamed: yaml-cognitive-architecture-structural-representation.md
        rationale: Represents cognitive architecture through YAML structure

      - original: stepsv2yaml.md
        renamed: cognitive-tagging-methodology-v2.md
        rationale: Describes the cognitive tagging methodology

  future_recommendations:
    - Continuously refine naming conventions
    - Maintain consistency in file naming across projects
    - Use naming to facilitate quick understanding of document content
    - Regularly review and update the renaming strategy
