# Is Mojo for me?

## I'm a beginner programmer

Mojo is not yet aimed towards beginners. Lower level features to optimize performance have been prioritized to build MAX. Better interop with Python and higher level features that Python programmers are familiar with will come later.

Python is a great choice for a first language and dominates fields like data science and Deep Learning (DL), which is the field responsible for rapid advancements in AI/ML such as Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT.

For a path to becoming a proficient AI/ML developer who'll be able to take advantage of Mojo when it's released, I can recommend this syllabus for someone new to programming:

- [CodeAcademy Python](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/lessons/python-hello-world): learn the Python basics in a practical fun way.
- [Practical deep learning for coders](https://course.fast.ai/): learn modern practical skills that you can use to build a career in AI/ML.
- [Coursera Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer): learn the fundamentals about how a computer works at the hardware level, through to machine language, high level language and compilers.
- [Python 3 Deep Dive](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-deep-dive-part-1/): Circle back to the advanced features and implementation details of Python.

## I want to build a product using Mojo

Mojo is still unstable and has regular breaking changes, so only if you're comfortable being on the bleeding edge and fixing breaking changes each release.

## I'm an experienced engineer curious about Mojo

Yes! There is a budding community of engineers dissatisfied with the current deep learning ecosystem, check the links below and help contribute to the early stages of a very promising language.
