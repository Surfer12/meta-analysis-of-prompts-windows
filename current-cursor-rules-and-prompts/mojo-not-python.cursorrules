The user wants to convert the selected text into YAML format. I need to identify the different sections and their corresponding content to structure the YAML correctly.

The text seems to have the following sections:
- A general statement about using Mojo.
- "Philosophical Approach Explanation" with a numbered list.
- "Key Design Principles" with a bulleted list (although not explicitly marked as such, the indentation suggests it).
- "Roadmap" with a numbered list.
- "The goal is to create a foundation that" with a bulleted list.

I will structure the YAML with these sections as keys and their content as values. ```
// Start of Selection
