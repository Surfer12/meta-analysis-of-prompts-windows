//can we create a bash command to launch our @Dockerfile that mimicks @README.md

I'll help you create a bash command to launch the Docker container based on the instructions in the README.md file. I'll propose a command using the Anthropic API method, which is the most straightforward approach.
I'll use the run_terminal_cmd to propose the command:
Let me break down the command for you:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here: Replace your_api_key_here with your actual Anthropic API key from the Anthropic Console
docker run: Runs a Docker container
-e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Passes your API key as an environment variable
-v $HOME/.anthropic:/home/computeruse/.anthropic: Mounts a local directory to persist settings
Port mappings:
-p 5900:5900: VNC connection
-p 8501:8501: Streamlit interface
-p 6080:6080: Desktop view
-p 8080:8080: Combined interface
-it: Interactive mode
ghcr.io/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts:computer-use-demo-latest: The official Docker image
After running this command, you can access:
Combined interface: http://localhost:8080
Streamlit interface: http://localhost:8501
Desktop view: http://localhost:6080/vnc.html
Direct VNC: vnc://localhost:5900
Would you like me to help you create an alias or script to make this even easier to launch?
Except we want to use our @analysis-of-prompts-v0.2

I'll help you create a Docker command to launch the container using the Dockerfile in the /Users/ryanoates/analysis-of-prompts-v0.2 directory. I'll first check the Dockerfile to understand the build process:
I see this Dockerfile has multiple stages, with a development stage that exposes ports 8501, 8888, and 5678. I'll propose a Docker command to build and run this image:
docker build -t analysis-of-prompts:dev . && docker run -p 8501:8501 -p 8888:8888 -p 5678:5678 -v $(pwd):/home/appuser/app -it analysis-of-prompts:dev /home/appuser/dev.sh notebook
I see the issue now. The Dockerfile has a COPY <<EOF command that didn't get executed during the build. Let me modify the command to explicitly specify the notebook launch:

```bash
docker build -t analysis-of-prompts:dev . && docker run -p 8501:8501 -p 8888:8888 -p 5678:5678 -v $(pwd):/home/appuser/app -it analysis-of-prompts:dev jupyter lab --allow-root --no-browser --port=8888

I'll help you create a Docker command to launch the container using the Dockerfile in the `/Users/ryanoates/analysis-of-prompts-v0.2` directory. I'll first check the Dockerfile to understand the build process:

Read file: /Users/ryanoates/analysis-of-prompts-v0.2/Dockerfile


I see this Dockerfile has multiple stages, with a development stage that exposes ports 8501, 8888, and 5678. I'll propose a Docker command to build and run this image:

```bash
cd /Users/ryanoates/analysis-of-prompts-v0.2 && docker build -t analysis-of-prompts:dev . && docker run -p 8501:8501 -p 8888:8888 -p 5678:5678 -v $(pwd):/home/appuser/app -it analysis-of-prompts:dev /home/appuser/dev.sh notebook
```


I see the issue now. The Dockerfile has a `COPY <<EOF` command that didn't get executed during the build. Let me modify the command to explicitly specify the notebook launch:

```bash
cd /Users/ryanoates/analysis-of-prompts-v0.2 && docker build -t analysis-of-prompts:dev . && docker run -p 8501:8501 -p 8888:8888 -p 5678:5678 -v $(pwd):/home/appuser/app -it analysis-of-prompts:dev jupyter lab --allow-root --no-browser --port=8888
```


Great! The Docker container is now running. Here's a breakdown of what the command does:

1. `cd /Users/ryanoates/analysis-of-prompts-v0.2`: Changes to the project directory
2. `docker build -t analysis-of-prompts:dev .`: Builds the Docker image
3. `docker run`: Runs the container with these options:
   - `-p 8501:8501 -p 8888:8888 -p 5678:5678`: Maps container ports to host ports
   - `-v $(pwd):/home/appuser/app`: Mounts the current directory into the container
   - `-it`: Interactive mode
   - `jupyter lab --allow-root --no-browser --port=8888`: Launches Jupyter Lab

You can access Jupyter Lab at:
- http://localhost:8888/lab?token=b48704d22193a15b9734bda2e27acde623a5cf959ac513be

Would you like me to create an alias or shell script to make this easier to launch in the future?

I'll help you create an alias for this Docker command. I'll first check the contents of the readme.txt to see if there are any specific instructions:

Read file: /Users/ryanoates/analysis-of-prompts-v0.2/readme.txt


I'll help you create an alias for this Docker command. I'll add it to your shell configuration file (`.zshrc` since you're using zsh):

```bash
echo "alias aop-dev='cd /Users/ryanoates/analysis-of-prompts-v0.2 && docker build -t analysis-of-prompts:dev . && docker run -p 8501:8501 -p 8888:8888 -p 5678:5678 -v \$(pwd):/home/appuser/app -it analysis-of-prompts:dev jupyter lab --allow-root --no-browser --port=8888'" >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```


I've created an alias `aop-dev` (short for "analysis-of-prompts-dev") that you can now use to launch your Docker development environment.

Here's what it does:
1. Changes to the project directory
2. Builds the Docker image
3. Runs the container with Jupyter Lab

To use it, simply type `aop-dev` in your terminal.

A few additional notes:
- The alias is now saved in your `~/.zshrc` file
- It will work from any directory
- It rebuilds the Docker image each time, ensuring you have the latest changes
- It launches Jupyter Lab on port 8888

Would you like me to explain anything else about the alias or make any modifications?
